-- 1. Import the dataset and do usual exploratory analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset:


-- 1.	Data type of all columns in the "customers" table.


-- 2.	Get the time range between which the orders were placed.


SELECT

CONCAT(DATE_DIFF(MAX(order_purchase_timestamp), MIN(order_purchase_timestamp),DAY)," ","days") AS time_period
FROM
`Olist_SQL_Business_Case.orders`;

SUM(count_cities) AS count_of_cities
FROM
